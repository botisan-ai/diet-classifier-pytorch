# diet-classifier-pytorch
PyTorch Implementation of Rasa's DIET Classifier.

The reason we are working on this project is to set up a PyTorch implementation of the DIET classifier for chatbots, so we can use it on our own chatbot projects. This allows us to ship the model on different platforms since we can build the model weights to ONNX.
